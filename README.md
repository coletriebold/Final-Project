# Arduino Drink Mixer

One-sentence summary of your project goes here. Then, make sure you have each of these sections completed:

## Summary

Here, write a few paragraphs (half a page?) or so describing the goals of your project. 

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

We will set out to create the finest drink mixer ever seen in Des Inv 23. Our goal is to create fine mixed drinks (coffee or alcoholic drinks, pending the suggestion of our instructor), using simple arduino components. We would like to have a complete interface, where the user can choose from either built in drink settings or create custom drinks using the ingredients that the machine will already have. Currently, we would like explore two options for user interfaces: an LED screen paired with buttons, or just basic buttons that have already been supplied to us. Our team does not have any experience programming LED screens, so we will inquire with our instructor as to whether or not that is a feasible option to pursue in the last five weeks of class. 

## Component Parts

From what pieces will you build your project? Will you build or buy those pieces?

Our project will begin by simply using the servo motors to move custom stoppers back and forth to control the flow of liquids. We will likey need another motor to supply linear movement of some kind to move the cup from on point to another to allow for different ingredients to be accessed. Once we begin to make the machine aestetically pleasing and more user friendly, we will likely need additional components to help increase the ease of use.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

Input: buttons+LCD or touchscreen interface to input what beverage or beverage mixture is desired.

Output: Different nozzles pouring different types of liquids into the cup to create the perfect beverage.

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what you anticipate will be the hardest and most time-consuming parts.

We anticipate that it will be very challenging to figure out the timing of all the components. For the built in settings, timing is key in making the movement of the cup, pouring of the liquid, and controlling the amount of liquid poured to combine into a delicious beverage. 

## Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible! 

- Week 1: Write proposal
