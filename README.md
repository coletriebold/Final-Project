# Arduino Drink Mixer

Our project is an automatic drink mixer that can be operated with the press of a button.

## Summary

We will set out to create the finest drink mixer ever seen in Des Inv 23. Our goal is to create fine mixed drinks (coffee or alcoholic drinks, pending the suggestion of our instructor), using simple arduino components. We would like to have a complete interface, where the user can choose from either built in drink settings or create custom drinks using the ingredients that the machine will already have by varying the proportion of selected liquids as well as total liquid volume to the user's desire. Currently, we would like explore two options for user interfaces: an LED screen paired with buttons, or just basic buttons that have already been supplied to us. Our team does not have any experience programming LED screens, so we will inquire with our instructor as to whether or not that is a feasible option to pursue in the last five weeks of class. 

## Component Parts

Our project will begin by simply using the servo motors to move custom stoppers back and forth to control the flow of liquids. We will likey need another motor to supply linear movement of some kind to move the cup from on point to another to allow for different ingredients to be accessed. Once we begin to make the machine aestetically pleasing and more user friendly, we will likely need additional components to help increase the ease of use. We can either source additional parts from the Jacobs MakerSpace store, or quickly decide which parts we need and purchase them through an online retailer.


Input: buttons + LCD or touchscreen interface to input what beverage or beverage mixture is desired and how much to dispense (proportion of each liquid and total liquid volume). These will be routed through the Arduino board.

Output: Different nozzles pouring different types of liquids into the cup to create the perfect beverage. We will need to optimize the mix levels to create the best drinks for a given volume.

## Challenges

We anticipate that it will be very challenging to figure out the timing of all the components. For the built in settings, timing is key in making the movement of the cup, pouring of the liquid, and controlling the amount of liquid poured to combine into a delicious beverage. The user interface will also probably take up a large chunk of our time as we want to make the interface intuitive. 

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Obtain all components, create initial prototype and work out any main theoretical issues
- Week 3: Obtain any components forgotten in the previous week, create a working, but not refined prototype
- Week 4: Finalize design, construct final machine and work on aesthetics
- Week 5: Present!
